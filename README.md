# Emoji-Sorter

This project uses data about emojis based on how often they appear next to certain kinds of words. The data was provided to me by Reed Coke and my challenge was to make a system that would take this information along with a dictionary relating emojis and their respective emoji codes and group them into groups using Kmeans clustering and then later experiment with other types of clustering in this case Birch and Affinity Propagation. The groups are random every time as a random state is not stated in the Kmeans. This was part of the challenge. 
This is part of the Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning using Python course taught by Reed Coke. Specifically level 3/15 lesson 5, the final lesson of that level. If you would like to know more about this please refer to the Hello World Studios website.
