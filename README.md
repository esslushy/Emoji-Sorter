# Emoji-Sorter

This project uses data about emojis based on how often they appear next to certain kinds of words. The data was provided to me and my challenge was to make a system that would take this information along with a dictionary relating emojis and their respective emoji codes and group them into groups using Kmeans clustering and then later experiment with other types of clustering in this case Birch and Affinity Propagation. The groups are random every time as a random state is not stated in the Kmeans as that was part of the challenge. This is part of the python challenges presented to me by the course I am taking by Hello World.
